This document logs changes made to 3D models. 
As a general rule of thumb, a new revision marks a new function or major geometric change to the design.
Sub-revisions (ex. REV1-2 vs REV1-3) are minor changes usually made for quality of life purposes or minor alterations like 3D printing tolerence adjustments.
A revision or sub-revision marked with *** means that it has not been tested yet.
