This document logs changes made to 3D models. 
As a general rule of thumb, a new revision marks a new function or major geometric change to the design.
Sub-revisions (ex. REV1-2 vs REV1-3) are minor changes usually made for quality of life purposes or minor alterations like 3D printing tolerence adjustments.
A revision or sub-revision marked with *** means that it has not been tested yet. 
- B

REV1: 
	Description:
		Initial design with fiber array holder affixed to arm.
	Flaws:
		Arm screw holes are of incorrect height and width.
		Base screw holes are in wrong places.
		Arm to base tolerences are too wide. (loose arm)
REV2: 
	Description:
		Updated design with detatchable fiber array holder capable of being magnetically attatched.
	Updates:
		Fiber array holder is now detatchable.
		A generally sleaker looking design. 
	Fixes:
		Arm screw holes are now perfect height and diameter. (Switched from m5 screw to 1/4 in)
		Base screw holes are alligned. 
		Arm tollerence issues are fixed.
	Flaws:
		Base screw holes are slightly too small.
		Fiber array holder to extender arm connector is too tight.
		1/4 in nut sockets are slightly too large.

	
REV2-1:
	Fixes:
		Base screw hole diameter adjusted.
		Fiber array to extender connecter loosened.
		1/4 in nut sockets tightened.
		Added punch hole to fiber array holder for printer support removal.
		Adjuster arm renamed to extender arm for consistency.
	Flaws:	
		60 degree offset from arm to hexapod x axis.
REV3:
	Fixes:
		60 degree offset removed.
