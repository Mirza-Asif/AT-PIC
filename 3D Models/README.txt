This folder contains all of the 3D model files for the Testbench. 

.SLDPRT files are the original solidworks desing files and may not be accesable without a licensce. If you are looking to alter these, or create new ones, I suggest the $40 a year Solidworks 3DExperience License.

.STL Files are the basic 3D model files that you can feed to your slicer for 3D Printing.

.gcode files are the sliced and printable files for printing. Note that gcode files are 3D printer model specific. Do not use a gcode file for one model of printer on another!

If you have any questions about these files, or how to edit them in solidworks, contact me at ben01morrison@gmail.com.
