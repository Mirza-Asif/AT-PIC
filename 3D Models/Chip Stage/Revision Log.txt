This document logs changes made to 3D models. 
As a general rule of thumb, a new revision marks a new function or major geometric change to the design.
Sub-revisions (ex. REV1-2 vs REV1-3) are minor changes usually made for quality of life purposes or minor alterations like 3D printing tolerence adjustments.
A revision or sub-revision marked with *** means that it has not been tested yet.

REV1: 
	Description:
		Initial test design to find correct screw hole locations.
	Flaws:
		No tube for vacuum.
		Innacurate Screw/mounting holes. 
		No screw holes for aluminum chip holder blocks.
REV2:
	Description: 
		Second test design with fillet corners, vacuum tube, and chip cutout.
	Flaws:
		Sizings are likely to be incorrect still.
		No screw holes for aluminum chip holder blocks.
REV3:	
	Description:
		First prototype with vacuum tube mount, tube, and chip cutout.
	Flaws:
	  	Was waaaay off on the tube diameter. Also the placement was bad.
REV4: 	Description:
		Made a mounting hole so that a metal tube connecter could be screwed in instead. Also moved the location to the corner of the stage.
	Flaws:
		The mounting holes size could probably be fine tuned for a better seal with the metal connector. 
		But if you arent looking to redesign and reprint, some sort of sealent would also do the job pretty well.
