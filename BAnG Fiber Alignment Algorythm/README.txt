This folder has all of the files relavent to a fiber alignment search algorythem that Ben Morrison and Ali Algadheebi made as their final ECE 544 project. 
I'm sure this algorythm is far from perfect, but may be an interesting starting point for future teams looking to automate fiber alignment. 
If you've got questions about it, you can contact ben at ben01morrison@gmail.com. 
If I dont reply within a day or two, it's probably because I'm terrible at checking my email, so feel free to shoot me a follow up email or two.  

Also I'd like to note that the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) was made for google colab and might requere some alterations if you want to use it in an IDE.
Mainly, it uses a library to link to you google drive (to find the .dat file) that I don't believe is available outside of colab.  
But it shouldnt take mutch tweaking if you dont want to use colab.
